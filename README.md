As CCBIO906 is approaching its end, we will finish off with the key lecture by **Rameen Beroukhim**, and this is a definite highlight of the course. Do not miss it.
Rameen is located in Boston, MA, and is affiliated with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard medical school, and the Broad intitute, one of the largest sequencing centers in the world. He focuses on brain cancer, but has a broad cancer interest, amongst them some collaborations in Bergen. He has been instrumental in TCGA CNA-working group, pan-cancer projects and develops his own analysis tools.
